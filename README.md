# Thesis Template
üë©‚Äçüéì A LaTeX template for writing your diploma thesis.


## File Structure

In the root directory are just two important files - the "master file" `thesis.tex` and `literature.bib`.

### Root Directory

The `thesis.tex` defines the LaTeX preamble and has links to all thesis chapters. This file is used to compile the entire thesis. The `literature.bib` is a BibTeX file including all your bibliography in a machine readable file format. This file is most likely generated by software like BibDesk.


### Chapters

All files related to a chapter are stored inside the `chp` directory. Chapters with sections and subsections have their own dedicated directories. There is a "main-file" for each chapter which is included into `thesis.tex` by `\include{chp/chapter_dir/chapter_main}`.

Sections are stored in separate files and are included into the chapter main file by `\input{chp/chapter_dir/section}`. Files included via `input` are simply copied into the main file during compilation.


### Media Files

Any type of media files is stored inside the `img` directory. This directory is specified as `\graphicspath` in the TeX preamble (see `thesis.tex`) so you just need to type the image name in `\includegraphics` (see `cover.tex`). If you use subdirectories for images, type `\includegraphics[]{sub_dir/sub_sub_dir/image_name}`.
